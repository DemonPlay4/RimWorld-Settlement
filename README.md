# RimWorld Simulated Settlements

This mod adds a text based colony management layer to RimWorld. Colonists can be sent on an expedition to found a remote settlement which is then handled purely through menus. Settlements generate reports, pay taxes and may even rebel if morale drops too low. All data is stored in a `WorldComponent` and therefore saved with the game.

The project contains C# sources only and does not include the compiled assembly.
